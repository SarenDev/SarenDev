Welcome and **< TRANSACTION START >**, I'm @SarenDev. 
- I work on Python, Java, and (somewhat) C# projects, while actively learning said languages.
- Not quite ready to work on anything big, but random passion projects are game
- I run a proggress log of sorts over on my ~~[Twitter](https://twitter.com/SarenDevX)~~[Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@SarenDev). Come stop by if you went through the trouble of reading this!

*Thanks for visiting and see you on the digital wave!* **< TRANSACTION END >**
