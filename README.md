Welcome and **< TRANSACTION START >**, I'm @SarenDev. 

- I work on Python, C#, and (somewhat) Java projects while actively learning said languages.
- The developer of [TrackLab/ViRe](https://github.com/TrackLab/ViRe) and other small passion projects
- Currently between social networks. Maybe my links go somewhere in the not-so-distant-future
<!-- - I run a progress log of sorts over on my ~~[Twitter](https://twitter.com/SarenDevX)~~[Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@SarenDev). Come stop by if you went through the trouble of reading this! -->

*Thanks for visiting and see you on the digital wave!* **< TRANSACTION END >**
